TOP Landing Page Project

This was a project completed while working through The Odin Project curriculum. The purpose of this project was to practice and present skills in basic HTML and CSS in the form of a basic landing page. A basic design was provided, with freedom to substitute our own content and design.

I used my husband's book he self-published several years ago as the subject for this project to give me something tangible and meaningful to work with. I planned the layout, design, and elements use Excalidraw.

I attempted to do as much as I could with the project from memory, and used my notes to help fill in gaps when I couldn't remember how to do something. I learned a couple new skills while completing this project, such as:
    -More customizations for buttons
    -Selecting specific images to style in CSS

Reflections:
Overall I'm pretty pleased with how the page turned out. I think it looks and feels cohesive, and with a few tweaks could be a decent, functioning author landing page.
I feel like I could have been more efficient with my Flexbox use - I wonder if I have too many divs, and if I could have needed less if I had formatted my Flexboxes differently. My copywriting needs work as well, but it's decent for what skills I'm actually trying to present.

Future Alterations:
There are a few things I'd like to change down the road, such as:
    -Build out the other pages linked to (About, Books, etc.)
    -Add a background image to the top "hero" section
    -Hover effects on images
    -Fancier button effects
    -Animations and/or sliding review quotes
